This is a project which consists of two seperate web pages made with HTLM, CSS (with Bootstrap) and JS (with Jquery) with a button that switches between them,
and also and API made with ADO.NET in C#.
The first page is a basic calculator that reads inputs from the user and sends them over to the Calculator API, which calculates the expression and sends the result back.
The second page is a table, with a UI that lets the user enter information about a certain person and displays it with the option to delete or update it.
